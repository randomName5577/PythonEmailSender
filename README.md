# PythonEmailSender
You can use the function here to send emails quickly and easily. Instead of having to set it up every time. You can just use the function and it will send the email out quickly. It is best used for simple emails without HTML. 

This script was part of a larger project, whose code is somewhere on some raspberry pi. The project was to send me emails updating me on the temperature of the house. Having lived in NY and being away from home for extended periods during the winter, I would need a way to check on the temperature of the house. Since the extreme cold could damage the integrity of the house. It would update me every 24 hours that everything is okay. If the temperature dropped too much, it would alert me.
